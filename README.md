# Yoga_Pose_Detection_and_Estimation
The Yoga Pose Detection and Estimation project is a real-time application that leverages Mediapipe to identify, analyze, and provide feedback on various yoga poses. Designed to enhance the yoga practice experience, this project uses computer vision to detect key body landmarks in real-time, allowing users to visualize their poses and adjust for better accuracy. By recognizing specific yoga poses through tracking the user’s body posture, it provides visual feedback on detected poses and overlays key points, helping users improve their alignment and posture during yoga practice.

The project is built using Python and uses OpenCV to capture and display video feeds, while Mediapipe provides the pose estimation functionality. When a user positions themselves in front of the camera, the system detects and maps key points on the user’s body, identifying various poses. Each pose is evaluated for accuracy, and visual cues are displayed on the screen to guide users toward adjustments that can improve their form. This makes the project especially useful for those looking to practice yoga with feedback, as it acts as a digital assistant to monitor and improve posture.

This tool is also fully open-source and flexible, allowing for potential expansion with additional poses or enhanced feedback mechanisms. In addition to yoga, the system can be adapted for other fitness applications or pose-based activities, making it a versatile solution for developers and fitness enthusiasts interested in real-time body pose detection.
